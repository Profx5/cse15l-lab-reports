Keys Pressed: `<x> <i> <2> <esc> and :wq`. Since my cursor was already at the location I needed to fix in the java file, I didn't have to move the cursor. I used `x` to delete the character 1 then at the exact location I pressed `i` to enter insert mode. I inserted the character `2` to replace the `1` and then I pressed escape to exit out of insert mode. To save my changes I pressed :wq.

## Step 8

I used 9 up arrows to access `git add ListExamples.java` which added ListExamples.java as one of the files I want to commit and push to Github and then another 9 up arrows to access `git commit -m "ListExamples.java updated"` which commits the checked files and then finally another 9 up arrows to access `git push origin main` which pushes my changes to Github.
